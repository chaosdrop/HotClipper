# HotCillper
Raw clipboard manager with an emphasis on hotstrings.

Global Hotkeys:
Win+I = New Clip from Clipboard

Win+H = Show the Clip Manager Window

Double clicking a Clip in the manager will load it into the clipboard.

Made in AHKv2

## FAQ 
### Why?
I had several programs that I wanted a universal template system for.
HotClipper allows me to keep plaintext, richtext, richview, and many more templates in a fast and universal way.
Saving me time and energy, by allowing me to keep all my templates in one place.

### Why AHKv2?
Because it had better raw clipboard handling than v1 and thus worked with more programs.

### Why Does it still not work in program X?
You're guess for program X would be as good as mine.

### Can you make it work for program X?
No. This is not a complex project and that would be beyond the scope of this simple project.
